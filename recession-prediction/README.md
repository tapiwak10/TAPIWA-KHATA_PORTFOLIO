# Predicting Economic Recession Using Machine Learning Methods
This project was a collaboration between myself and four other students. The main objective of this assignment was to come up with an ML solution to a real life problem of our choice, we decided to focus on developing a machine learning model that predicts recession using algorithms such as SVM.
